## So in this project we are going to perform multi-region Web Server deployment with EBS Volume Management.

####  Firstly check it out task file, where you can understand what exactly to perform in this project. 

####  For both the topics ( multi-region Web Server deployment and EBS Volume Management ) I have created separate files and explain all the steps with screenshots one by one.

#### Conclusion:- 

     High Availability and Redundancy: Multi-region deployment ensures that your web application is resilient to failures in one region. By distributing your servers across different             geographic locations, you reduce the risk of downtime due to regional outages or disasters.
