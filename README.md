## So in this project we are going to perform multi-region Web Server deployment with EBS Volume Management.

####  Firstly check it out task file, where you can understand what exactly to perform in this project. 

####  For both the topics ( multi-region Web Server deployment and EBS Volume Management ) I have created separate files and explain all the steps with screenshots one by one.

#### Conclusion:- 

* High Availability and Redundancy: Multi-region deployment ensures that your web application is resilient to failures in one region. By distributing your servers across different            geographic locations, you reduce the risk of downtime due to regional outages or disasters.

* Latency Optimization: Placing servers closer to your users (geographically) can help reduce latency and improve the overall performance of your web application. This is particularly 
  important for applications with a global user base.

* Data Consistency: Managing EBS volumes across multiple regions requires careful consideration of data consistency and synchronization. You need strategies such as cross-region replication or distributed databases to ensure that data is up-to-date across all regions.

* Disaster Recovery: Multi-region deployments are crucial for disaster recovery. In case of a catastrophic failure in one region, your application can failover to another region seamlessly if properly configured.

* Elastic Block Store (EBS) Management: Proper management of EBS volumes involves monitoring performance metrics, optimizing storage configurations (e.g., choosing appropriate volume types like General Purpose SSD, Provisioned IOPS SSD, or Magnetic), and implementing backups and snapshots for data protection.
